This github contains all code for all of my projects that have been completed. Some projects were created for fun, or others may have been a requirement for a class that has been taken.

Copy and paste my code into the text file and clicl "run" Make sure the #DEFINE PIN is in the coorisponding pin as the wires show on the virtual arduino. 
Click run and wait, and you should see the animation!
